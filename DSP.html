					<!-- Start edit here  -->
					The primary aim of our project is to build Gender classification system based on the speech.The system includes feature extractor which extracts 
MFCC(Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) and we also extract delta coefficients,delta-delta coefficients from MFCC and generate a feature vector.Then we do spherical
k-means clustering and then we implement bag of words and then predict the gender.

					Speech is the most natural and efficient way of communication between humans.This project aims at classifying the gender from speech.The first step is to extract 
feature from the audio data.One of the best features that are available with respect to the frequency of identifying gender is
 MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients).It is a non-parametric frequency domain approach, which is based on a human 
auditory perception system.

						<pre>Gender recognition of speaker from speech has various potential applications.There are various publications targeting different set of
features and 
using different methodologies for classification.For example in Sparse Estimation Technique, Auto-correlation function of speech is
extracted from
fundamental frequency which is used for identifying the gender.The reported recognition accuracy is 90 to 95%. But the fundamental 
frequency extraction
may be difficult in case of noisy environment.In this situation more complex methods can be proposed to improve fundamental
frequency estimation.
In Mel Frequency CepstralCoefficients (MFCC), features are extracted for voiced vowels where the distinction of male/female
is most significant 
& accuracy is better.




					A robust gender detection system is developed by Zeng et al.The developed system has been tested for the
noisy environment, 
and dependency of the language is also considered for the evaluation of the system. The obtained accuracy is 95%,which shows 
the robustness of the developed system against noise. 
The experiment shows that the system is independent of language as well.Relative spectral
PLP features and pitch of the male and female speakers are used for gender detection. 
Chen et al. proposed a gender detection system for children
of two age groups of 8-9 years and 16-17 years. 
The obtained accuracies are 60% and 94%, respectively, for two age groups. 
Different acoustic 
features, source spectral magnitude, cepstral peak prominence, and harmonic-to-noise ratio, are used to implement the system. 
Sedaaghi conducted
comparative study for the gender detection by using two different databases. 
Various classifiers and acoustic features are used for gender 
classification system, and the best reported accuracy is 95%. 
A total of 113 features are used in the study and Bayes classifier is used for 
feature selection.
 
An automatic gender detection system for Hindi speech is developed by using MFCC as features and 
Euclidean distance as a 
classification method. The authors have mentioned in this study that the same features can be used for gender and speech recognition.However,use 
of same features for both recognition systems cannot guarantee good performance.</pre>

				<div class="text">

					<!-- Start edit here  -->
					The Proposed approach for this Project is first to extract the MFCCs(mel frequency cepstral coefficients) and next we have to compute the Delta coefficients,Delta-Delta coefficients from the MFCCs.Now we make a feature vector comprising of all the above coefficients and now we fed it to the Sperical K-means clusturing algorithem.We also computed bagofwords which is computed by using training datasets of male and female by clusturing them.
