					The primary aim of our project is to build Gender classification system based on the speech.The system includes feature extractor which extracts 
MFCC(Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) and we also extract delta coefficients,delta-delta coefficients from MFCC and generate a feature vector.Then we do spherical
k-means clustering and then we implement bag of words and then predict the gender.

					Speech is the most natural and efficient way of communication between humans.This project aims at classifying the gender from speech.The first step is to extract 
feature from the audio data.One of the best features that are available with respect to the frequency of identifying gender is
 MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients).It is a non-parametric frequency domain approach, which is based on a human 
auditory perception system.

						Gender recognition of speaker from speech has various potential applications.There are various publications targeting different set of
features and 
using different methodologies for classification.For example in Sparse Estimation Technique, Auto-correlation function of speech is
extracted from
fundamental frequency which is used for identifying the gender.The reported recognition accuracy is 90 to 95%. But the fundamental 
frequency extraction
may be difficult in case of noisy environment.In this situation more complex methods can be proposed to improve fundamental
frequency estimation.
In Mel Frequency CepstralCoefficients (MFCC), features are extracted for voiced vowels where the distinction of male/female
is most significant 
& accuracy is better.<br>
						<br>


					A robust gender detection system is developed by Zeng et al.The developed system has been tested for the
noisy environment, 
and dependency of the language is also considered for the evaluation of the system. The obtained accuracy is 95%,which shows 
the robustness of the developed system against noise. 
The experiment shows that the system is independent of language as well.Relative spectral
PLP features and pitch of the male and female speakers are used for gender detection. 
Chen et al. proposed a gender detection system for children
of two age groups of 8-9 years and 16-17 years. 
The obtained accuracies are 60% and 94%, respectively, for two age groups. 
Different acoustic 
features, source spectral magnitude, cepstral peak prominence, and harmonic-to-noise ratio, are used to implement the system. 
Sedaaghi conducted
comparative study for the gender detection by using two different databases. 
Various classifiers and acoustic features are used for gender 
classification system, and the best reported accuracy is 95%. 
A total of 113 features are used in the study and Bayes classifier is used for 
feature selection.
 
An automatic gender detection system for Hindi speech is developed by using MFCC as features and 
Euclidean distance as a 
classification method. The authors have mentioned in this study that the same features can be used for gender and speech recognition.However,use 
of same features for both recognition systems cannot guarantee good performance.

						The Proposed approach for this Project is first to extract the MFCCs(mel frequency cepstral coefficients) and next we have to compute the Delta coefficients,Delta-Delta coefficients from the MFCCs.Now we make a feature vector comprising of all the above coefficients and now we fed it to the Sperical K-means clusturing algorithem.We also computed bagofwords which is computed by using training datasets of male and female by clusturing them.

						Firstly, we start the discussion of how we start the project? We have looked upon the internet to find the ways to classify the gender. We have many ideas like MFCCS, short term energies, pitch etc.. but we finally opted to use MFCC because by using MFCC we can get the result with much better accuracy. Now our aim is to write the code in much simpler way with least number of lines possible and we understand that the use functions can help us with that. The Functions which we defined for this Project are <b>mfcc_r, frames_window_r, trifilter_r, deltamfcc, lab_s, normalize_norm_mean, normalize_norm, SPKmean.<br><br></b>
 The Function <a href = "https://github.com/mvssuryateja/Project/blob/master/mfcc_r.m" style = "text-decoration:none;" target = "_blank" title = "Click here for mfcc_r code!"><b><i>mfcc_r</i></b></a>   generates the MFCCs of the given audio sample. Before giving input audio sample to <b>mfcc_r</b> ,the parts which having amplitude less than 0.1 (arbitrarily chosen by observing audio samples) are eliminated. <b>mfcc_r</b> uses to other functions for framing and windowing (<a href = "https://github.com/mvssuryateja/Project/blob/master/frames_window_r.m" style = "text-decoration:none;" target = "_blank" title = "Click here for frames_window_r code!"><i><b>frames_window_r</b></i></a>) and to increase the amplitudes we will use triangular filter bank(<a href = "https://github.com/mvssuryateja/Project/blob/master/frames_window_r.m" style = "text-decoration:none;" target = "_blank" title = "Click here for trifilter_r code!"><i><b>trifilter_r</b></i></a>). This function firstly, starts by checking whether the given inputs are correct and if all given required inputs are given, if not it terminates the whole algorithm. Secondly, it converts the given inputs frame shift and frame duration into samples and finds the length of the FFT required based on the sampled frame duration samples. Thirdly, it does pre-emphasis and later speech is framed and windowed(<b>frames_window_r</b>). Fourthly, it does FFT for each frames and next we multiply with triangular filter bank(<b>trifilter_r</b>), so that along with the amplitudes, the difference between higher and lower amplitudes gets amplified too. Next, we convert to mel-scale because mel-scale converts the input into a scale which computer understands as the human voices differentiating from environmental voices. Finally, we do the Discrete cosine transform and we limit the coefficients to 13 because in general 13 coefficients are required to classify gender. These coefficients are called mel-frequency cepstral coefficients(MFCC).<br><br>
 We extract deltamfcc coefficients and delta-deltamfc coefficients by giving MFCC input to function (<a href = "https://github.com/mvssuryateja/Project/blob/master/deltamfcc.m" style = "text-decoration:none;" target = "_blank" title = "Click here for deltamfcc code!"><i><b>deltamfcc</b></i></a>).  we computed   MFCC, deltamfcc, delta-deltamfcc .and then we append them horizontally making a feature vector comprising all the above mentioned coefficients. Now we use the Bag-of-words technique to make the whole training data feature vectors into 2 clusters by the use of Spherical k-means clustering and later we find the mean of the whole male data samples feature vectors and also for female data samples. we found out the cluster1 mean is almost close to female data mean and cluster 2 mean is closer to male data mean. So now we consider cluster1 as female and cluster2 as male.<br><br>
 We take these two cluster means generated for whole data samples of male and female and compare the test data samples by using function <b>lab_s</b> which gives the output percentage of male and percentage of female in the gives test sample and finally outputs male or female by comparing the percentages.<br><br>
 The whole functions runs in the following matlab codes <b>gclass_r</b> – used to generate the feature vector for single sample, <b>train_r.m</b> – used to generate the feature vector for whole training data samples, <b>SPK_m</b> – used to do spherical k means clustering, <b>test_dm</b> runs the whole male data samples, <b>test_df</b> runs for whole female data samples. We finally find out the gender.

					<div class="text">

						<!-- Start edit here  -->
						The approach we followed is based on Supervised learning. we have extracted MFCC, Delta MFCC, Delta-Delta MFCC vectors for the trianing data sets for both male and 
female. Then we have used Spherical K-Means algorithm to which we feed both male and female training data sets and generate 2 clusters. The clusters of male and female
or otherwise the bag of words are recognized by comparing them to the means generated from male and female training sets seperately. Next we will feed the test datasets
of male and female and compare each column vector with column vectors of means from the bag of words which then decides the gender.
